            <p class="author">By: Ajdin Masic</p>

            <p>The idea that a significant number of businesses still don’t have websites in 2017 is inexplicable. A recent <a href="http://press.capitalone.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251626&p=irol-newsarticle&ID=2229054" target="_blank">study by Capital One</a> reported that only 56% of small businesses claim to have a company website. The emergence of content management systems has made web development easier, and there’s no reason why your business should not have a website already. If you are sitting on the fence on this website issue, take a look at some of the benefits that your business stands to gain by having an online presence.</p>

            <h3>Low-cost advertising</h3>

            <p>The internet has literally broken down the global walls, and the world has become one small village. The web has an extensive reach, and it trumps every other advertising platform in that respect. You need to have a website to tap into this enormous potential.</p>

            <p>A website will become the center of your business’ online presence. Any advertising you do on the web including email marketing, social media advertising and pay-per-click advertising will revolve around it. Granted, it might take a while before your website can start enjoying enough traffic for your marketing campaign to have any meaningful impact, but it is affordable for you to gain such traffic.</p>

            <h3>Business discoverability</h3>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.score.org/resource/infographic-5-reasons-your-small-business-needs-website" target="_blank">study conducted by Verisign</a> found that 9 out of 10 consumers use the internet to search for local goods and services. In light of these numbers, it becomes difficult to understand why 46% of small businesses are yet to create websites. Companies that have an online presence have a distinct advantage as far as discoverability is concerned.</p>

            <p>Majority of consumers are looking for goods and services online. If they can’t locate your business, they will end up buying from your competitors instead. With search engine optimization, it is easier for potential consumers to interact with your business 24/7 and to learn about the products and services you offer.</p>

            <h3>Relatability</h3>

            <p>A website gives you the ability to build relationships and relate to a defined audience. You can use your site to tell your story and that of your business and help create long-lasting relationships that will benefit your business in the long term. If the consumer can relate to your business and products, they will buy from you.</p>

            <p>When customers want to learn about your business, they are less likely to pick up a phone and call. Most of them will prefer to visit your website. When they are replying to social media comments and emails, you are personalizing your business experience and creating trust. These customers are likely to buy from you again.</p>

            <h3>Building credibility</h3>

            <p>The value of credibility for any business cannot be overstated. If your trust factor is high, you will have more options to grow your business and make money. Having a website raises your credibility significantly especially in the eyes of the consumer. According to the same <a href="https://www.score.org/resource/infographic-5-reasons-your-small-business-needs-website" target="_blank">study conducted by Verisign</a> , a whopping 84% of consumers regard businesses with websites as more credible than those without websites.</p>

            <p>The days of matchbook advertising are way behind us. If you want your business to remain relevant and reliable in 2017, you need to have a website. There are no two ways about it. If all your competitors have websites and you don’t, who do you think looks more credible in the eyes of the consumer?</p>

            <h3>Increasing sales</h3>

            <p>A site can serve as a good face for your company. It can also be an excellent tool for advertising. But one possibility that many brick and mortar business owners fail to realize is the ability to create a whole new business channel by using the website as an online store. You don’t have to use the website to direct consumers to your physical business; it can be a business by itself.</p>

            <p>With omnichannel retailing taking over the retail space, it has become necessary for retailers to synchronize their brick and mortar businesses with their online businesses. Consumers prefer to buy from retailers who can provide a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels. If your business is to provide such an experience, you will need to create a parallel online business.</p>

            <h3>Web presence analytics</h3>

            <p>Unlike other advertising platforms, the web accords you the opportunity to gauge the impact of your marketing strategy using web analytical tools. They will collect valuable data about your marketing campaigns and their effect on consumer habits. You will know things such as:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Your visitors’ demographics</li>
                <li>How the visitors found your site</li>
                <li>The number of visitors to your site</li>
                <li>Which pages they visit most</li>
                <li>How much time they spend on the pages</li>
                <li>How frequent the visitors return to the site</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Such valuable information will help you identify which campaigns are working and which are not and what you need to do more or change. Where would you get such information if you didn’t have a website? A customer will not exactly walk into your office and tell you how they came to know about you.</p>

            <h3>Why not?</h3>

            <p>You should build a website for your business because there’s absolutely no excuse to do so. Web development is easier and cheaper than ever. If you have no clue where to begin, we are always here to help. At Web Solutions, LLC, we will develop and design the website for you. We will also assist you in content marketing and search engine optimization. We can also manage your Google analytics, marketing campaigns and much more.</p>

            <h3>But I already have social media!</h3>

            <p>You should not use social media as an excuse not to have a website for your business. Social media is a great platform, but you can never equate it to having a website. A site gives you a 100% control of your online activities. You are not operating at someone else’s mercy. You own the data, and your content is directed to the relevant audience.</p>

            <p>Building a website for your business is an absolute necessity in 2017. It doesn’t matter what type of business you operate; it is bound to benefit by having an online presence. If you don’t have web design skills, don’t worry; at Web Solutions, we will do all the heavy lifting for you including web design, web development, search engine optimization, content marketing and much more. The online marketing space is expanding. If you don't have a website, you will never compete effectively.</p>
